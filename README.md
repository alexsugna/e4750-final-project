Implementing Parallel Non-Negative Matrix Factorization

Non-Negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised machine learning technique often used in recommendation systems.

In this project we investigate and compare various serial and parallel implementations of NMF. See `E4750_2021Fall_SSAA_sls2305_ala2197.report` for a detailed report of the project. 

### Repository Index

`data` - dataset files used for implementing NMF including the NYT dataset </br>
`dev` - unpolished code that was used for developing our NMF implementations on the way to the final versions in `src` </br>
`figures` - plots generated in `Plotting.ipynb` and `Demonstration.ipynb` get saved here </br>
`kernels` - CUDA (.cu) kernel files </br>
`src` - final polished versions of our NMF implementations and various helper functions. Code contains extensive comments and documentation. </br>
`Demonstration.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook to demonstrate how to use our code </br>
`Measurement.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for measuring execution times of NMF implementations </br>
`Plotting.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for generating plots from measurements </br>
`execution_times.csv` - grid execution parameters and runtimes </br>

# e4750_2021Fall_Project
Seed (team/shared) repo for team projects
  - distributed as Github Repo and shared via Github Classroom
  - contains only README.md file
  - The students should upload their project code into the repo
  - The organization of the directories, python, CUDA and OpenCL files has to be meaningful, and described in this README file

# Detailed instructions how to submit this assignment/homework/project:
1. The project assignment will be distributed as a github classroom assignment - as a special repository accessed through a link
2. A students copy of the repo gets created automatically with a special name -> students have to rename the repo per instructions below
3. The project code has to be submitted inside this repository 

## (Re)naming of the project repository shared by multiple students (TODO students)
INSTRUCTIONS for (re)naming the students' solution repository for assignments with more students, such as the final project. Students need to use a 4-letter groupID: 
* Template: e4750-2021Fall-Project-GroupID-UNI1-UNI2-UNI3. -> Example: e4750-2021Fall-Project-MEME-zz9999-aa9999-aa0000.
